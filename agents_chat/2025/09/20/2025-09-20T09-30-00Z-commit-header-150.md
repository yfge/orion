---

User original prompt and requirements
- 「把长度改到１５０ 吧」

Background and goals
- Reduce CI friction for descriptive subjects while preserving conventional structure and English requirement.

Changes
- commitlint `header-max-length`: 100 → 150.

Outcome and impact
- Fewer length violations. Encourage moving details to body if subject approaches the limit.

Next steps
- Monitor CI; if long subjects become noisy, consider bringing it back to 120–140, or enforce body usage in contribution docs.
